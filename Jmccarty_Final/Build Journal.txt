1. I made the line height a little easier to read.
2. Also, I made the margins of the content greater so that you read
in a column, that way it's easier on the eyes.
3. Screwing with fonts could go on forever, but I'm settled on one thing.
4. I need to make media queries for the site size.
5. I've changed the background to white, as it makes it look cleaner to the viewing eye.
6. Also, I've figure out how to embed a Google Calendar onto the site, that way whoever is in the lab can post events going on and such.

1. Time to add the finishing touches. I need to make the site mobile responsive.
2. I found places where you can minify your CSS to make the page load faster. If somebody needs to see your code, you can reveal the
beautified version so it's not just a jumbled up mess.
3. Media queries is turning out to be harder than I initially thought.
4. I was finally able to integrate the sidebar to the site, and I was able to embed
a Google calendar for an example of an event calendar we could use.

1. I looked at the Kobo eReaders (Kobo Aura) because they are supposedly more open-source than the Kindle.
I just need something that will support ePub/mobi books, more open source book formats.
But I also like just reading physical books.
2. For Linux distros, I want to have either Mint, Kubuntu, Ubuntu Gnome, or ElementaryOS.

KDE, Cinnamon, Gnome
Kubuntu, KDE Neon, KDE Something or other
